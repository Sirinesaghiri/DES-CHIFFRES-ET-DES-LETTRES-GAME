"Des Chiffres et des Lettres" is a game where you use both words and numbers. It has two parts. In the first part, you pick letters, both vowels and consonants, to create the longest word possible from those letters. In the second part, you have to use some given numbers to reach a target number using basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to get as close to that target number as you can.
